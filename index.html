        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Heyy:) My name is Ewuraba Buckle<br><br>
        Um, a little about me... I am currently a 17-year old junior at Wheeler High School. My parents were both born and raised in Ghana, but my older brothers and I were all born in Kansas. yuck. i know. We soon moved to Georgia though so it's all good.<br>
        Anyways, I'm still kinda new to this coding thing soo I'm not really sure what this website is for at the moment. I'm just trying things out and get better at HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but I promise this will look wayy better soon. Nevertheless, I took my first coding class/camp the summer before eighth grade. It was pretty cool. And I took AP Comp Sci Principles last year, soo like I'm basically a pro now.I still clearly have a lot to learn but I do know the basics of Java, Python, and HTML for now. </p>

        <b>End to Poverty Adventure - Game</b>
        <br>
        This is the very first game I individually coded, using Java. I began programming it during an all girl's summer camp at Georgia Tech in 2018, in which I was introduced to the programming language of Java.
        It's a choice-based game in which the player is asked a series of questions and must answer them correctly in order to stop world poverty.

        <b>Save The Tortugas - Game</b>
        <br>
        This is one of the first games I coded, using Java. I began programming it during an all girl's summer camp at Georgia Tech in 2019, in which I expanded my Java knowledge.
        Players use the arrow keys to control a recycle bin. The goal of the game is to collect all the plastic off the beach shore before the turtle (tortuga) reaches the bottom.
